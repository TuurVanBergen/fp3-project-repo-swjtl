# Template Repository for FP3 - README.md

## Overview
Welcome to your repository! This template serves as a starting point for students embarking on web development projects. It provides a basic structure and essential files to kickstart your Node.js backend and frontend development.

You are free to use and build upon this repository as you wish. But this repository must contain all the code you develop throughout these 3 weeks. This readme is a document that you will develop further. Teachers should be able to use this readme to run your project seamlessly.

### Key Features
- **Node.js Backend**: A `server.js` file is included as the entry point for your Node.js server.
- **Express Framework**: Express is pre-installed to help you build your server efficiently.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilize the `.env` file for environment variables. Use the `dotenv` library for managing these variables in Node.js.
- **Environment Templates**: Templates like `local.env` and `production.env` are recommended for different deployment scenarios.
- **Public Folder**: A `public` directory is available for storing all your static assets.
- **App Folder**: The `app` folder is designated for your frontend development.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install required dependencies, including Express and `dotenv`.

3. **Set Up Environment Files**:
   - Copy the `.env` file to create environment-specific files like `local.env` and `production.env`.
   - Customize these files with your project-specific variables.

4. **Running the Server**: Start your server using `node server.js`. Ensure that your environment variables are set up correctly.

5. **Developing the Frontend**: Navigate to the `app` folder to begin your frontend development.

## Customization
As you progress with your project, you should update and customize this README to reflect your own development process and documentation. Include details about:
- Project-specific setup instructions.
- Additional dependencies you might add.
- Features and functionalities of your project.
- Any other relevant information that would aid in understanding and using your project.

Your documentation should evolve as your project grows. Happy coding!
